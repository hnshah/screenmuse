- Smoke test threshold raised to 40 — was failing on fast machines
- Export test added to CI smoke suite

## [1.5.4] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- `ThumbnailExtractor`: CFString cast crash on certain video codecs

## [1.5.3] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed

## [1.5.2] — 2026-03-24

- Unused variable warnings cleaned up

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `packages/screenmuse-playwright` — npm package for recording Playwright automation sessions. Zero boilerplate: `sm.record(async () => { ... })` wraps focus, window position, hide-others, start, and stop. Works as a Playwright Test fixture or standalone helper.
- `examples/playwright-demo/` — runnable demo showing how to record a browser automation session end-to-end

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `POST /note` — drop a timestamped note into the usage log mid-recording (e.g. "audio dropped here")
- `POST /script` and `POST /script/batch` — run shell commands mid-session; batch runs a list in order
- `GET /annotate` — retrieve all notes from the current session
- MCP server (`mcp-server/`) — exposes ScreenMuse tools to Claude Desktop and Cursor via the Model Context Protocol

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `POST /ocr` — on-device OCR via Apple Vision (no API key, macOS 14+). Read text from screen or an image file. Supports `fast` and `accurate` modes.
- `POST /thumbnail` — extract a single frame from the last recording at a given timecode
- `POST /crop` — crop a rectangular region from the last recording
- `GET /openapi` — machine-readable OpenAPI spec (JSON). Use with Postman, Claude, Cursor, or any OpenAPI-compatible tool.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- Region recording — pass `region: {x, y, width, height}` to `POST /start` to record a specific area of the screen
- Webhooks — pass `webhook: "https://..."` to `POST /start` to get a POST callback with video path when recording stops
- `GET /timeline` — structured JSON of all chapters, highlights, and notes (live or after stop)
- `POST /concat` — combine two or more recordings into one. Use `"last"` to reference the most recent file.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `GET /stream` — SSE endpoint for real-time frame streaming (JPEG or PNG, configurable fps and scale). Stays open until client disconnects.
- `GET /stream/status` — shows active SSE client count

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Smoke test threshold now matches actual endpoint count
- `/version` `endpoint_count` reflects true count (self-computing from endpoint array)

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- 4 build errors from Vera's v1.0.1 bug report (actor isolation, type mismatches)

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Eliminated all `viewModel` references in `ScreenMuseServer` — server is now fully decoupled from SwiftUI

### Added
- `POST /trim` — fast stream-copy trim (no re-encode, near instant). Pass `reencode: true` for frame-accurate trim.
