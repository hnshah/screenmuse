# Changelog

All notable changes to ScreenMuse are documented here.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-11 Sprint 4

### Added
- **`POST /browser`** — headless Playwright recording. Spawns a Node subprocess that launches a headful Chromium window at the requested URL, optionally runs a user script in page context (`page`, `context`, `browser` in scope), and records the window through the standard ScreenMuse capture pipeline. Returns the enriched stop response plus a `browser` block with `url_requested`, `url_final`, `title`, `pid`, `exit_code`, and any `script_error`/`nav_error`. Honors `duration_seconds` (1–600), `width`, `height`, `name`, `quality`, and `async`.
- **`POST /browser/install`** — idempotent installer that writes `~/.screenmuse/playwright-runner/` and runs `npm install` + `npx playwright install chromium`. First install downloads ~130MB. Supports `async=true` for job-queue execution.
- **`GET /browser/status`** — inspects the runner install without triggering anything: `runner_directory`, `runner_script_exists`, `runner_script_version`, `playwright_installed`, `node_path`, `npm_path`, `ready`.
- **`Browser/`** subdirectory in `ScreenMuseCore`: `RunnerScript.swift` (embedded Node source), `NodeRunnerInstaller.swift` (filesystem + npm orchestration), `BrowserRecorder.swift` (subprocess lifecycle + SM: line-protocol parser + `EventBox` primitive).
- **`BrowserHandlerTests`** — 27 tests covering request validation, config JSON encoding, installer status, PATH lookup, runner script integrity, and the `EventBox` async primitive.
- **Python client**: `browser()`, `browser_install()`, `browser_status()` methods on `ScreenMuseClient`.
- **Node/TS client**: `browser()`, `browserInstall()`, `browserStatus()` plus `BrowserResult`, `BrowserInstallResult`, `JobResult` types.
- OpenAPI spec entries for `/browser`, `/browser/install`, `/browser/status`. `OpenAPISpecDriftTests` updated with the three new paths.

### Design notes
- The Swift binary remains **zero external dependencies**. Node + Playwright live entirely under `~/.screenmuse/playwright-runner/`, installed on-demand, so users who don't use `/browser` never download anything.
- Headless mode is explicitly rejected (`HEADLESS_NOT_SUPPORTED`) — browser recording requires a visible Chromium window for macOS-level screen capture to see it. Playwright's internal video recording would defeat the purpose of using ScreenMuse.
- The Node runner speaks a minimal line-based protocol on stdout (`SM:READY`, `SM:SCRIPT_OK`, `SM:DONE`, etc.) so Swift can coordinate the recording lifecycle with the browser lifecycle. Swift writes `GO\n` to the runner's stdin after starting the recording, so the user script never runs against an unrecorded frame.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-04 Sprint 3

### Added
- **Request ID in every response** — `sendResponse()` now automatically injects `"request_id"` into every JSON response body. No callsite changes — threaded through the single choke point. Enables distributed tracing for agent workflows.
- **`POST /qa`** — HTTP API for QA analysis. Pass `original` + `processed` video paths, get back the full `QAReport` JSON (5 quality checks, confidence score, before/after metrics). Optional `save` param (default true) saves `qa-report.json` beside processed video.
- **`POST /diff`** — Structural diff between any two video files. Returns metadata for both + delta (duration, file size, bitrate, resolution changed, fps changed, codec changed).
- **Baseline QA for no-effects recordings** — When recording without effects (no before/after to compare), ffprobe validity check runs in background; surfaces error if output is corrupted.
- **`RecordingsPaginationTests`** — 22 tests covering limit/offset/sort/hasMore logic, edge cases, and full-pagination consistency (paging through all 23 items in 5-item pages).
- **Codable types** for `/qa` (`QARequest`) and `/diff` (`DiffRequest`, `DiffResponse`).
- **OpenAPI spec** updated with `/qa` and `/diff` endpoint definitions.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-04 Sprint 2 (QA Engine)

### Added
- `GET /recordings` now supports pagination: `?limit=N&offset=N&sort=asc|desc`. Response includes `total`, `count`, `limit`, `offset`, `has_more` fields. Backward-compatible (no params = return all).
- **Python client**: 10 new methods for full API coverage — `script()`, `script_batch()`, `report()`, `debug()`, `logs()`, `jobs()`, `get_job()`, `stream_status()`, `start_pip()`, `upload_icloud()`. All with docstrings.
- **TypeScript/Node.js client**: Same 10 new methods with full JSDoc type annotations.
- **Codable types** in `APITypes.swift` for `TrimRequest`, `SpeedRampRequest`, `ChapterRequest`, `HighlightResponse`, `NoteRequest`.
- **`ScreenMuseConfigTests`** — 18 new tests for config file round-trip, defaults, tilde expansion.
- **HTTP route tests** for `POST /record` and `POST /script/batch` dispatch table coverage.

### Verified (no changes needed)
- 65KB body limit: already fixed via `accumulateBody()` + `receiveNextChunk()` streaming pattern with 4MB cap.
- Port configurability: fully implemented via `SCREENMUSE_PORT` env, `~/.screenmuse/config.json`, and `--port` CLI flag.
- Config file support: `ScreenMuseConfig` at `~/.screenmuse.json` supports all 6 fields.
- OpenAPI spec audit: 47/47 paths in spec match router dispatch table — zero drift.
- Demo tape: `docs/demo.tape` and `docs/CONTRIBUTING-DEMO.md` already exist.

### Research
- Landscape: Screenpipe (main competitor) runs as MCP server with passive capture. Mux (Jan 2026) added AI narration. Community building screenshot+narration MCP tools for monitoring diffs and auto-documentation.
- New backlog items added: `POST /browser` (headless Playwright), `POST /narrate` (AI narration), `POST /diff` (change detection), `POST /publish` (multi-destination), continuous capture mode.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added
- `POST /validate` — run quality checks on a recording (duration, frame count, no black frames, text-at-time OCR)
- `POST /frames` — extract multiple frames from a video at given timestamps (PNG or JPG)
- `screenmuse-playwright`: smart PID fallback via `/windows` when `browser.process().pid` returns null on macOS
- `screenmuse-playwright`: public `findBrowserWindow()` helper for manual browser window discovery
- OCR debug mode — pass `"debug": true` to `/ocr` for image size, upscale info, block count, and avg confidence

### Fixed
- `/stop` now returns enriched response: path, duration, size, size_mb, resolution, fps, chapters, notes, session_id, window info — never returns undefined
- OCR auto-upscale: images < 1000px wide are upscaled to 1440px before Vision API for better accuracy on small frames/GIFs

### Changed
- `screenmuse-playwright` README rewritten with installation, troubleshooting (multiple Chrome windows, GitHub virtual scrolling, PID null, window not found), Playwright Test fixture integration, and full API reference

## [1.5.5] — 2026-03-24

- Smoke test threshold raised to 40 — was failing on fast machines
- Export test added to CI smoke suite

## [1.5.4] — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- `ThumbnailExtractor`: CFString cast crash on certain video codecs

## [1.5.3] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `POST /note` — drop a timestamped note into the usage log mid-recording (e.g. "audio dropped here")

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `GET /stream` — SSE endpoint for real-time frame streaming (JPEG or PNG, configurable fps and scale). Stays open until client disconnects.
- `GET /stream/status` — shows active SSE client count

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-24

## [1.0.1] — 2026-03-24
